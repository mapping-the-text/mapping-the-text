# Mapping the Text

We are a collective of scholars who investigate the spatiotemporalities
produced within a text, understood broadly as an aesthetic object. We don’t
study literature in space (such as a novel’s spread around the world in
translation). Rather, we study space in literature, such as how New York City
is produced in a poem.

This repository, for the time being, is a website for a conference in on 21
April 2018 at New York University, sponsored by both the [NYU English
Dept](http://as.nyu.edu/english.html) and the [NYU
Libraries](http://library.nyu.edu).

But it’s also a collection of scholars. And of projects. And of articles. And
of news.

The idea is that we’re currently a rather scattered bunch. Some of us are
geohumanists. Others are geocritics. Others are literary geographers. Still
others are digital geospatial humanists. And some of us simply think of
ourselves as scholars in the humanities who can’t think of a humanistic line
of inquiry that is agnostic to spatiotemporal questions.
