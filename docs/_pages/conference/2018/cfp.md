<p class="lead">Proposals for papers and panels are now being accepted for the
“Mapping the Text” conference to be held at New York University on Saturday 21
April 2018. The conference will be held in conjunction with the annual Culture
Mapping event hosted at New York University, which will occur on Friday 20
April 2018.  The Culture Mapping event will be hosted by
[NewYorkScapes](http://newyorkscapes.org), a research community dedicated to
exploring the literary, historical, and social aspects of the city of New York
using digital forms of scholarship.</p>

Our scholarly landscape surrounds us with spatial turns in both the humanities
and social sciences. Additionally, the arrival of mapping software suites with
low barriers to entry has prompted a new interest in supplementing these
spatial turns with digital, geographical visualizations. The boons to fields
like history or archaeology and anthropology have been immediately apparent,
but other humanistic fields have often made use of this software mostly to
answer historiogeographically driven questions, namely by using digital
geospatial visualizations to show how objects have moved through the “real
world” to generate networks of influence, such as in Stanford’s “[Mapping the
Republic of Letters](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/)” project. In so
doing, this work reproduces a distinct separation between the world outside a
text and world(s) inside a text.

In “Mapping the Text,” our aim is to convene scholars who have crossed this
line and begun linking the “real world”(s) mediated by software packages with
the worlds that emerge inscribed within texts, where both “worlds” and “texts”
are understood broadly. Topics for papers, panels, or posters should feature
both spatiotemporal/digital components of textual analysis and could include,
for example: doing geospatial work on a budget, doing geospatial work on texts
from before or outside the Cartesian plane, geospatial visualization in
contrast to or supplementing analysis, minor texts and minor geographies,
handling and creating geospatial data, teaching the geospatial through texts,
and more.

All proposals for papers and panels must be submitted through the [conference’s
webform](/conference/2018/submit). We seek a diverse group of proposals from a
diverse group of scholars, both in terms of their geography and institutional
affiliations as well as in their positions in their careers.

There may be some funding available for non-US / non-faculty panelists.

The deadline for submissions is December 22, 2017.

With any questions about the “Mapping the Text” conference, please contact its
organizer, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, New York University, at
moacir@mapping-the-text.org

We look forward to receiving your submissions.
