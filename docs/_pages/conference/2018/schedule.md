<p class="small">Sally Bushell is Professor of Romantic and Victorian Literature in the Department of English Literature & Creative Writing, Lancaster University. She is also Head of Department (2014–18) and Co-Director of The Wordsworth Centre. Her research seeks to open up new modes of interpretation for the literary
work by enlarging the focus of literary criticism from interpretation of
semantic content onto comparative understanding of other aspects of the
literary work in ways that not only illuminate traditional models but,
potentially, re-determine them.  Her first book was entitled [_Text as Process:
Creative Composition in Wordsworth, Tennyson and
Dickinson_](http://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/1022) (Virginia UP, 2009). 
Her second book which will go to press in 2019 is called _Reading and Mapping:
Spatialising the Text_ and is centered upon the relationship between
visual/spatial and verbal meanings for the literary work, offering an
integrated reading of spatial meaning through map and text. </p>


<!-- She is also -->
<!-- interested in future ways of reading and spatializing literature through the -->
<!-- digital medium and is PI on a major (£900,000) AHRC project: “Creating a -->
<!-- Chronotopic Ground for the Mapping of Literary Texts” (2017-2020) which -->
<!-- enables the generation of a map or spatial visualization out of the text -->
<!-- itself for any work of literature (with or without real-world correspondence) -->
<!-- and adapts gaming platforms to create new ways of reading literature in -->
<!-- digital space that combine text and image in an iterative way. -->
